# QUERY EXPANSION USING WORDNET FOR SYNONYMS
Query Expansion (QE) is a technique used in information retrieval and search engines to enhance user queries by adding related words or synonyms. This improves search accuracy by retrieving more relevant results.
## How It Works
User Input – The user enters a search query.<br>
Expansion Process – The system identifies synonyms, related words, or alternative phrases.<br>
Modified Query – The expanded query includes the original terms + additional words.<br>

This is simple implementation of query expansion for synonyms using wordnet, where the user passes the word for which the expanded query is expected.
